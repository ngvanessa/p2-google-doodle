## Overview

The Chinese Dragon Boat Festival is a yearly holiday that is celebrated in China. Over the past 2,000 years, dragon boat racing has been practiced over 50 countries and is the fastest water sport today. This holiday is meant as a time to protect individuals from evil and disease. 

Originally, the idea of dragon boat racing came from villagers trying to recover Qu Yhan, a renowned poet, body. People would paddle their boats to try and rescue him. “However, he was banished after opposing an alliance the king wanted to enter into and eventually Qu Yhan passed away by drowning himself in the Miluo River on fifth day of the fifth month.” Due to this unfortunate event, it has been believed and rumored that participants in the boat racing competition would drop balls of sticky rice in hopes of the fish eating them instead of Yhan’s body. 

Since the rise of the event in 2008, individuals from around the globe have been participating in the famous boat race. In fact, Boston has been hosting an annual Dragon Boat Race since 1979. This date is the oldest race in North America. Nearly over 20,000 people participate and spectate on an annual basis. Consequently, there is usually over 50 teams that canoe down the Charles River.
 
On the contrary, New York is the second largest race with over 120 dragon boat teams from across North America. Similar to what would be celebrated in China, this event includes activities such as: Chinese music, dancing performances and lion dancing. 

Putting history aside, some of the activities that the audience can watch ranges from: boat racing in the shape of dragons – this is meant as a traditional to attempt to rescue the poet Chu Yhan, having traditional dragon and lion dances and Japanese Taiko Drumming. Aside from these activities, individuals are allowed to participate in martial arts, arts and crafts and zongi wrapping.
